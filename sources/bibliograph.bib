@article{Ellermeier2006,
abstract = {We describe a three-protein signal-transduction pathway that governs immunity to a protein toxin involved in cannibalism by the spore-forming bacterium Bacillus subtilis. Cells of B. subtilis enter the pathway to sporulate under conditions of nutrient limitation but delay becoming committed to spore formation by killing nonsporulating siblings and feeding on the dead cells. Killing is mediated by the exported toxic protein SdpC. We report that extracellular SdpC induces the synthesis of an immunity protein, SdpI, that protects toxin-producing cells from being killed. SdpI, a polytopic membrane protein, is encoded by a two-gene operon under sporulation control that contains the gene for an autorepressor, SdpR. The autorepressor binds to and blocks the promoter for the operon. Evidence indicates that SdpI is also a signal-transduction protein that responds to the SdpC toxin by sequestering the SdpR autorepressor at the membrane. Sequestration relieves repression and stimulates synthesis of immunity protein. ©2006 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Xiao2008,
abstract = {Bacterial yield prediction is critical for bioprocess optimization and modeling of natural biological systems. In previous work, an expanded thermodynamic true yield prediction model was developed through incorporating carbon balance and nitrogen balance along with electron balance and energy balance. In the present work, the application of the expanded model is demonstrated in multiple growth situations (aerobic heterotrophs, anoxic, anaerobic heterotrophs, and autolithotrophs). Two adjustments are presented that enable improved prediction when additional information regarding the environmental conditions (pH) or degradation pathway (requirement for oxygenase- or oxidase-catalyzed reactions) is known. A large data set of reported yields is presented and considered for suitability in model validation. Significant uncertainties of literature-reported yield values are described. Evaluation of the model with experimental yield values shows good predictive ability. However, the wide range in reported yields and the variability introduced into the prediction by uncertainty in model parameters, limits comprehensive validation. Our results suggest that the uncertainty of the experimental data used for validation limits further improvement of thermodynamic prediction models.},

@article{Heijnen1992,
abstract = {Correlations for the prediction of biomass yields are valuable, and many proposals based on a number of parameters (Y(ATP), Y(Ave), eta(o), Y(c), Gibbs energy efficiencies, and enthalpy efficiencies) have been published. This article critically examines the properties of the proposed parameters with respect to the general applicability to chemotrophic growth systems, a clear relation to the Second Law of Thermodynamics, the absence of intrinsic problems, and a requirement of only black box information. It appears that none of the proposed parameters satisfies all these requirements. Particularly, the various energetic efficiency parameters suffer from major intrinsic problems. However, this article will show that the Gibbs energy dissipation per amount of produced biomass (kJ/C-mod) is a parameter which satisfies the requirements without having intrinsic problems. A simple correlation is found which provides the Gibbs energy dissipation/C-mol biomass as a function of the nature of the C-source (expressed as the carbon chain length and the degree of reduction). This dissipation appears to be nearly independent of the nature of the electron acceptor (e.g., O(2), No(3) (-), fermentation). Hence, a single correlation can describe a very wide range of microbial growth systems. In this respect, Gibbs energy dissipation is much more useful than heat production/C-mol biomass, which is strongly dependent on the electron acceptor used. Evidence is presented that even a net heat-uptake can occur in certain growth systems.The correlation of Gibbs energy dissipation thus obtained shows that dissipation/C-mol biomass increases for C-sources with smaller chain length (C(6) --> C(1)), and increases for both higher and lower degrees of reduction than 4. It appears that the dissipation/C-mol biomass can be regarded as a simple thermodynamic measure of the amount of biochemical "work" required to convert the carbon source into biomass by the proper irreversible carbon-carbon coupling and oxidation/reduction reactions. This is supported by the good correlation between the theoretical ATP requirement for biomass formation on different C-sources and the dissipation values (kJ/C-mol biomass) found. The established correlation for the Gibbs energy dissipation allows the prediction of the chemotrophic biomass yield on substrate with an error of 13\% in the yield range 0.01 to 0.80 C-mol biomass/(C)-mol substrate for aerobic/anaerobic/denitrifying growth systems.},

@article{Kiersztyn2012,
abstract = {This study analyzes proteolytic enzyme persistence and the role of dead (or metabolically inactive) aquatic bacteria in organic matter cycling. Samples from four lakes of different trophic status were used. Irrespective of the trophic status of the examined lakes, bacterial aminopeptidases remained active even 72 h after the death of the bacteria that produced them. The total pool of proteolytic enzymes in natural lake water samples was also stable. We found that the rates of amino acid enzymatic release from proteinaceous matter added to preserved lake water sample were constant for at least 96 h (r(2)  = 0.99, n = 17, P ≤ 0.0001, V(max)  = 84.6 nM h(-1) ). We also observed that proteases built into bacterial cell debris fragments remained active for a long time, even after the total destruction of cells. Moreover, during 24 h of incubation time, about 20\% of these enzymatically active fragments adsorbed onto natural seston particles, becoming a part of the 'attached enzymes system' that is regarded as the 'hot-spot' of protein degradation in aquatic ecosystems.},

Kinetic parameters (K(m) and V(max)) were estimated from substrate consumption curves by resting cell suspensions with [S]sulfate and [C]acetate. Both sulfate and acetate consumption followed Michaelis-Menten saturation kinetics. The half-saturation constant (K(m)) for acetate uptake was 70 muM with cells from either long-term sulfate- or long-term acetate-limited chemostat cultures. The average K(m) value for sulfate uptake by D. postgatei was about 200 muM. K(m) values for sulfate uptake did not differ significantly when determined with cells derived either from batch cultures or sulfate- or acetate-limited chemostat cultures. Acetate consumption was observed at acetate concentrations of </=1 muM, whereas sulfate uptake usually ceased at 5 to 20 muM. The results show that D. postgatei is not freely permeable to sulfate ions and further indicate that sulfate uptake is an energy-requiring process.},

abstract = {Significantly more carbon is stored in the world's soils--including peatlands, wetlands and permafrost--than is present in the atmosphere. Disagreement exists, however, regarding the effects of climate change on global soil carbon stocks. If carbon stored belowground is transferred to the atmosphere by a warming-induced acceleration of its decomposition, a positive feedback to climate change would occur. Conversely, if increases of plant-derived carbon inputs to soils exceed increases in decomposition, the feedback would be negative. Despite much research, a consensus has not yet emerged on the temperature sensitivity of soil carbon decomposition. Unravelling the feedback effect is particularly difficult, because the diverse soil organic compounds exhibit a wide range of kinetic properties, which determine the intrinsic temperature sensitivity of their decomposition. Moreover, several environmental constraints obscure the intrinsic temperature sensitivity of substrate decomposition, causing lower observed 'apparent' temperature sensitivity, and these constraints may, themselves, be sensitive to climate.},

Several methods have been used by microbiologists, biotechnologists, and environmental engineers. This manuscript illustrates that these formulations are related. Yields predicted by estimation of Gibbs energy of dissipation and yields predicted by assumed efficiency of energy capture are comparable. Direct comparison of yield predictions from different methods shows the effects of assumptions inherent in the methodologies. Mathematical relationships between estimated values from the different methods help identify the best predictions from each method to bound the estimate of bacterial yield.},

abstract = {Descriptive kinetics of batch cellulose (Avicel) and cellobiose fermentation by Clostridium thermocellum were examined with residual substrate and biosynthate concentrations inferred based on elemental analysis. Biosynthate was formed in constant proportion to substrate consumption until substrate was exhausted for cellobiose fermentation, and until near the point of substrate exhaustion for cellulose fermentation. Cell yields (g pellet biosynthate carbon/g substrate carbon) of 0.214 and 0.200 were obtained for cellulose and cellobiose, respectively. For cellulose fermentation a sigmoidal curve fit was applied to substrate and biosynthate concentrations over time, which was then differentiated to calculate instantaneous rates of growth and substrate consumption. Three models were tested to describe the kinetics of Avicel utilization by C. thermocellum: (A) first order in cells, (B) first order in substrate, and (C) first order in cells and substrate, and second order overall. Models (A) and (B) have been proposed in the literature to describe cultures of cellulolytic microorganisms, whereas model (C) has not. Of the three models tested, model (c) provided by far the best fit to batch culture data. A second order rate constant equal to 0.735 L g C(-1)  h(-1) was found for utilization of Avicel by C. thermocellum. Adding an endogenous metabolism term improved the descriptive quality of the model as substrate exhaustion was approached. Such rate constants may in the future find utility for describing and comparing cellulose fermentation involving other microbes and other substrates.},

@article{Fiegna2006,
abstract = {Obligate relationships have evolved many times and can be parasitic or mutualistic. Obligate organisms rely on others to survive and thus coevolve with their host or partner. An important but little explored question is whether obligate status is an evolutionarily terminal condition or whether obligate lineages can evolve back to an autonomous lifestyle. The bacterium Myxococcus xanthus survives starvation by the social development of spore-bearing fruiting bodies. Some M. xanthus genotypes defective at fruiting body development in isolation can nonetheless exploit proficient genotypes in chimaeric groups. Here we report an evolutionary transition from obligate dependence on an altruistic host to an autonomous mode of social cooperation. This restoration of social independence was caused by a single mutation of large effect that confers fitness superiority over both ancestral genotypes, including immunity from exploitation by the ancestral cheater. Thus, a temporary state of obligate cheating served as an evolutionary stepping-stone to a novel state of autonomous social dominance.},

abstract = {An isolate of an acidophilic archaeon, strain YT, was obtained from a bioleaching pilot plant. The organism oxidizes ferrous iron as the sole energy source and fixes inorganic carbon as the sole carbon source. The optimal pH for growth is 1.7, although growth is observed in the range pH 1.3 to 2.2. The cells are pleomorphic and without a cell wall. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed this strain to cluster phylogenetically within the order 'Thermoplasmales' sensu Woese, although with only 89.9 and 87.2\% sequence identity, respectively, to its closest relatives, Picrophilus oshimae and Thermoplasma acidophilum. Other principal differences from described species of the 'Thermoplasmales' are autotrophy (strain YT is obligately autotrophic), the absence of lipid components typical of the ' Thermoplasmales' (no detectable tetraethers) and a lower temperature range for growth (growth of strain YT occurs between 15 and 45 degrees C). None of the sugars, amino acids, organic acids or other organic compounds tested was utilized as a carbon source. On the basis of the information described above, the name Ferroplasma acidiphilum gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed for strain YT within a new family, the Ferroplasmaceae fam. nov. Strain YT is the type and only strain of F. acidiphilum. This is the first report of an autotrophic, ferrous-iron-oxidizing, cell-wall-lacking archaeon.},

abstract = {Ferroplasma is a genus of the Archaea, one of the three branches of the tree of life, and belongs to the order Thermoplasmatales (Euryarchaeota), which contains the most acidophilic microbes yet known. Ferroplasma species live in acid mine drainage, acidic pools and environments containing sulphidic ores such as pyrite and characterized by pH values of 0-2 and high concentrations of ferrous iron and other heavy metals. F. acidiphilum strain Y(T) is a chemoautotroph that grows optimally at pH 1.7 and gains energy by oxidizing ferrous iron and carbon by the fixation of carbon dioxide. Here we show that 86\% of 189 investigated cellular proteins of F. acidiphilum are iron-metalloproteins. These include proteins with deduced structural, chaperone and catalytic roles, not described as iron-metalloproteins in any other organism so far investigated. The iron atoms in the proteins seem to organize and stabilize their three-dimensional structures, to act as 'iron rivets'. Analysis of proteins of the phylogenetic neighbour Picrophilus torridus and of the habitat neighbour Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans revealed far fewer and only typical metalloproteins. F. acidiphilum therefore has a currently unique iron-protein-dominated cellular machinery and biochemical phylogeny.},

Genes annotated as thymidine phosphorylase (deoA) and eucaryal translation initiation factor 2B (e2b2) were found to encode AMP phosphorylase and ribose-1,5-bisphosphate isomerase, respectively. These enzymes supplied the RuBisCO substrate, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate, from AMP and phosphate. Archaea with type III RuBisCOs all harbor both DeoA and the corresponding E2b2 homologs. In this pathway, adenine was released from AMP and the phosphoribose moiety entered central-carbon metabolism.},

abstract = {Proteorhodopsins are bacterial light-dependent proton pumps. Their discovery within genomic material from uncultivated marine bacterioplankton caused considerable excitement because it indicated a potential phototrophic function within these organisms, which had previously been considered strictly chemotrophic. Subsequent studies established that sequences encoding proteorhodopsin are broadly distributed throughout the world's oceans. Nevertheless, the role of proteorhodopsins in native marine bacteria is still unknown. Here we show, from an analysis of the complete genomes of three marine Flavobacteria, that cultivated bacteria in the phylum Bacteroidetes, one of the principal components of marine bacterioplankton, contain proteorhodopsin. Moreover, growth experiments in both natural and artificial seawater (low in labile organic matter, which is typical of the world's oceans) establish that exposure to light results in a marked increase in the cell yield of one such bacterium (Dokdonia sp. strain MED134) when compared with cells grown in darkness. Thus, our results show that the phototrophy conferred by proteorhodopsin can provide critical amounts of energy, not only for respiration and maintenance but also for active growth of marine bacterioplankton in their natural environment.},

Fifty-five BACs carried diverse proteorhodopsin genes, and we confirmed the function of five. We calculate that proteorhodopsin-exploiting bacteria account for 13\% of microorganisms in the photic zone. We further show that some proteorhodopsin-containing bacteria possess a retinal biosynthetic pathway and a reverse sulfite reductase operon, employed by prokaryotes oxidizing sulfur compounds. Thus, these novel phototrophs are an unexpectedly large and metabolically diverse component of the marine microbial surface water.},

abstract = {This review focuses on what has been learned about the evolution of photosynthesis in the past five years, and omits evolution of CO2 assimilation. Oxygenic photosynthesis using both photosystems I and II) has evolved from anoxygenic photosynthesis. The latter occurs in different variants, using either a type 1 photosystem resembling photosystem I, or a type 2 photosystem resembling photosystem II. Opinions differ as to how two types of photosystem came to be combined in the same organism, whether by gene transfer between bacteria, by fusion of bacteria, or as a result of gene duplication and evolution within one kind of bacterium. There are also different opinions about when oxygenic photosynthesis arose, in conjunction with the Great Oxygenation Event, 2.3 billion years before the present, or more than a billion years before that. Cyanobacteria were the first organisms to carry out oxygenic photosynthesis. Some of them gave rise to chloroplasts, while others continued to evolve as independent organisms, and the review outlines both lines of evolution. At the end we consider the evolution of photosynthesis in relation to the evolution of our planet.},

abstract = {Anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) is critical for controlling the flux of methane from anoxic environments. AOM coupled to iron, manganese and sulphate reduction have been demonstrated in consortia containing anaerobic methanotrophic (ANME) archaea. More recently it has been shown that the bacterium Candidatus 'Methylomirabilis oxyfera' can couple AOM to nitrite reduction through an intra-aerobic methane oxidation pathway. Bioreactors capable of AOM coupled to denitrification have resulted in the enrichment of 'M. oxyfera' and a novel ANME lineage, ANME-2d. However, as 'M. oxyfera' can independently couple AOM to denitrification, the role of ANME-2d in the process is unresolved. Here, a bioreactor fed with nitrate, ammonium and methane was dominated by a single ANME-2d population performing nitrate-driven AOM. Metagenomic, single-cell genomic and metatranscriptomic analyses combined with bioreactor performance and (13)C- and (15)N-labelling experiments show that ANME-2d is capable of independent AOM through reverse methanogenesis using nitrate as the terminal electron acceptor. Comparative analyses reveal that the genes for nitrate reduction were transferred laterally from a bacterial donor, suggesting selection for this novel process within ANME-2d. Nitrite produced by ANME-2d is reduced to dinitrogen gas through a syntrophic relationship with an anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing bacterium, effectively outcompeting 'M. oxyfera' in the system. We propose the name Candidatus 'Methanoperedens nitroreducens' for the ANME-2d population and the family Candidatus 'Methanoperedenaceae' for the ANME-2d lineage. We predict that 'M. nitroreducens' and other members of the 'Methanoperedenaceae' have an important role in linking the global carbon and nitrogen cycles in anoxic environments.},

abstract = {Modern agriculture has accelerated biological methane and nitrogen cycling on a global scale. Freshwater sediments often receive increased downward fluxes of nitrate from agricultural runoff and upward fluxes of methane generated by anaerobic decomposition. In theory, prokaryotes should be capable of using nitrate to oxidize methane anaerobically, but such organisms have neither been observed in nature nor isolated in the laboratory. Microbial oxidation of methane is thus believed to proceed only with oxygen or sulphate. Here we show that the direct, anaerobic oxidation of methane coupled to denitrification of nitrate is possible. A microbial consortium, enriched from anoxic sediments, oxidized methane to carbon dioxide coupled to denitrification in the complete absence of oxygen. This consortium consisted of two microorganisms, a bacterium representing a phylum without any cultured species and an archaeon distantly related to marine methanotrophic Archaea. The detection of relatives of these prokaryotes in different freshwater ecosystems worldwide indicates that the reaction presented here may make a substantial contribution to biological methane and nitrogen cycles.},

abstract = {Only three biological pathways are known to produce oxygen: photosynthesis, chlorate respiration and the detoxification of reactive oxygen species. Here we present evidence for a fourth pathway, possibly of considerable geochemical and evolutionary importance. The pathway was discovered after metagenomic sequencing of an enrichment culture that couples anaerobic oxidation of methane with the reduction of nitrite to dinitrogen. The complete genome of the dominant bacterium, named 'Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera', was assembled. This apparently anaerobic, denitrifying bacterium encoded, transcribed and expressed the well-established aerobic pathway for methane oxidation, whereas it lacked known genes for dinitrogen production. Subsequent isotopic labelling indicated that 'M. oxyfera' bypassed the denitrification intermediate nitrous oxide by the conversion of two nitric oxide molecules to dinitrogen and oxygen, which was used to oxidize methane. These results extend our understanding of hydrocarbon degradation under anoxic conditions and explain the biochemical mechanism of a poorly understood freshwater methane sink. Because nitrogen oxides were already present on early Earth, our finding opens up the possibility that oxygen was available to microbial metabolism before the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis.},

Strong geochemical evidence for net methane consumption in anoxic sediments is based on methane profiles, radiotracer experiments and stable carbon isotope data. But the elusive microorganisms mediating this reaction have not yet been isolated, and the pathway of anaerobic oxidation of methane is insufficiently understood. Recent data suggest that certain archaea reverse the process of methanogenesis by interaction with sulphate-reducing bacteria. Here we provide microscopic evidence for a structured consortium of archaea and sulphate-reducing bacteria, which we identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization using specific 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes. In this example of a structured archaeal-bacterial symbiosis, the archaea grow in dense aggregates of about 100 cells and are surrounded by sulphate-reducing bacteria. These aggregates were abundant in gas-hydrate-rich sediments with extremely high rates of methane-based sulphate reduction, and apparently mediate anaerobic oxidation of methane.},

Here, we show that microorganisms from marine methane-seep sediment in the Eel River Basin in California are capable of using manganese (birnessite) and iron (ferrihydrite) to oxidize methane, revealing that marine AOM is coupled, either directly or indirectly, to a larger variety of oxidants than previously thought.

abstract = {Genome sequences of two Synechococcus ecotypes inhabiting the Octopus Spring microbial mat in Yellowstone National Park revealed the presence of all genes required for nitrogenase biosynthesis. We demonstrate that nif genes of the Synechococcus ecotypes are expressed in situ in a region of the mat that varies in temperature from 53.5 degrees C to 63.4 degrees C (average 60 degrees C); transcripts are only detected at the end of the day when the mat becomes anoxic. Nitrogenase activity in mat samples was also detected in the evening. Hitherto, N2 fixation in hot spring mats was attributed either to filamentous cyanobacteria (not present at >50 degrees C in these mats) or to heterotrophic bacteria. To explore how energy-generating processes of the Synechococcus ecotypes track natural light and O2 conditions, we evaluated accumulation of transcripts encoding proteins involved in photosynthesis, respiration, and fermentation. Transcripts from photosynthesis (cpcF, cpcE, psaB, and psbB) and respiration (coxA and cydA) genes declined in the evening. In contrast, transcripts encoding enzymes that may participate in fermentation fell into two categories; some (ldh, pdhB, ald, and ackA) decreased in the evening, whereas others (pflB, pflA, adhE, and acs) increased at the end of the day and remained high into the night. Energy required for N2 fixation during the night may be derived from fermentation pathways that become prominent as the mat becomes anoxic. In a broader context, our data suggest that there are critical regulatory switches in situ that are linked to the diel cycle and that these switches alter many metabolic processes within the microbial mat.},

abstract = {Biosignatures and structures in the geological record indicate that microbial life has inhabited Earth for the past 3.5 billion years or so. Research in the physical sciences has been able to generate statements about the ancient environment that hosted this life. These include the chemical compositions and temperatures of the early ocean and atmosphere. Only recently have the natural sciences been able to provide experimental results describing the environments of ancient life. Our previous work with resurrected proteins indicated that ancient life lived in a hot environment. Here we expand the timescale of resurrected proteins to provide a palaeotemperature trend of the environments that hosted life from 3.5 to 0.5 billion years ago. The thermostability of more than 25 phylogenetically dispersed ancestral elongation factors suggest that the environment supporting ancient life cooled progressively by 30 degrees C during that period. Here we show that our results are robust to potential statistical bias associated with the posterior distribution of inferred character states, phylogenetic ambiguity, and uncertainties in the amino-acid equilibrium frequencies used by evolutionary models. Our results are further supported by a nearly identical cooling trend for the ancient ocean as inferred from the deposition of oxygen isotopes. The convergence of results from natural and physical sciences suggest that ancient life has continually adapted to changes in environmental temperatures throughout its evolutionary history.},

@article{Bonneville2006,
abstract = {A kinetic model for the microbial reduction of Fe(III) oxyhydroxide colloids in the presence of excess electron donor is presented. The model assumes a two-step mechanism: (1) attachment of Fe(III) colloids to the cell surface and (2) reduction of Fe(III) centers at the surface of attached colloids. The validity of the model is tested using Shewanella putrefaciens and nanohematite as model dissimilatory iron reducing bacteria and Fe(III) colloidal particles, respectively. Attachment of nanohematite to the bacteria is formally described by a Langmuir isotherm. Initial iron reduction rates are shown to correlate linearly with the relative coverage of the cell surface by nanohematite particles, hence supporting a direct electron transfer from membrane-bound reductases to mineral particles attached to the cells. Using internally consistent parameter values for the maximum attachment capacity of Fe(III) colloids to the cells, Mmax, the attachment constant, KP, and the first-order Fe(III) reduction rate constant, k, the model reproduces the initial reduction rates of a variety of fine-grained Fe(III) oxyhydroxides by S. putrefaciens. The model explains the observed dependency of the apparent Fe(III) half-saturation constant, Km
*, on the solid to cell ratio, and it predicts that initial iron reduction rates exhibit saturation with respect to both the cell density and the abundance of the Fe(III) oxyhydroxide substrate. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},
