# Equations of a Living Planet

**Subtitle:** The Energy Rules Behind Earth’s Chemical Cycles

Earth looks alive because it is—chemically. Not in a poetic sense, but in a measurable one: gradients form, reactions run, electrons move, and microbes make a planet behave like an engine.

This book is about those hidden rules: energy budgets, redox reactions, transport, and the microbial metabolisms that turn chemistry into cycles.

It grew out of notes I kept during my PhD at the University of Waterloo, and I’m rewriting it into a coherent, readable narrative.

The style is popular-science readable, but it keeps the quantitative backbone: when an equation matters, it shows up—and it earns its place.

## What you’ll find here
- **A story about constraints**: why “possible” isn’t “happens”, and how kinetics, transport, and maintenance costs shape ecosystems.
- **Sediments as a unifying stage**: mud as a reactor you can walk on, where invisible processes leave measurable profiles.
- **From stories to predictions**: how conservation laws and simple models turn intuition into something testable.
