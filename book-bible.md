# Book Bible (v0.1)

## One‑sentence promise
A physics‑minded, story‑driven guide to how microbes survive on tight energy budgets, why that creates predictable reaction patterns in sediments and groundwater, and how reaction–transport models turn those patterns into forecasts for methane, CO\(_2\), and water quality.

## Target reader (default)
- Scientifically curious readers (grad‑student level curiosity, not necessarily specialists)
- Environmental scientists/engineers who want intuition for RTMs without a “pure math” text
- Anyone who’s looked at a porewater profile and thought: “This is telling a story—I just can’t read it yet.”

## Voice and style rules
- **Story‑first**: chapters open with a scene/paradox (field, lab, or “thought experiment”), then earn the abstractions.
- **Physics‑native metaphors**: use metaphors that genuinely map to the science (circuits, resistance, boundary layers), not cute mascots.
- **Rigor without heaviness**: keep the main narrative light; move derivations out of the flow.
- **No black boxes**: when we simplify, we say what we sacrificed (and what we kept).
- **Microbes are characters**: not cartoons—real organisms with constraints, strategies, and tradeoffs.
- **Concrete observables**: regularly return to what you would actually measure (profiles, fluxes, rates, proxies).

## Three‑layer reading (so nobody gets lost)
- **Main text**: story + intuition; minimal equations; emphasize constraints and “what would happen if…”
- **Equation Corner callouts**: 1–3 key equations, with units and meaning; one small back‑of‑the‑envelope estimate when helpful
- **Appendices**: clean derivations, extra math, and “if you want the full machinery” details

## Physics‑forward mental models (recurring)
### Microbe as a battery + circuit
- **Electron donor** = anode (high chemical potential electrons)
- **Electron acceptor** = cathode (low chemical potential electrons)
- **Enzymes/kinetics** = internal resistance (how hard it is to move charge through the microbe’s machinery)
- **Transport limits** = external resistance (how hard it is to deliver reactants/remove products)
- **Power** \(\approx\) (energy per electron) \(\times\) (electron flux)

### Sediment as a reaction–diffusion medium
Redox “zones” are emergent structure, like boundary layers: they arise because transport is limited and reactions are selective.

### Thermodynamics vs kinetics (always together)
- **Thermodynamics**: available work (what is possible; how much “payment” exists)
- **Kinetics + biology**: how fast you can cash it; whether it covers maintenance; what is accessible under constraints

## A small toolkit of “back‑of‑the‑envelope” physics
Use short, satisfying estimates to anchor intuition:
- Diffusion timescale: \(\tau \sim L^2/D\)
- Energy–voltage bridge: \(\Delta G = -nF\Delta E\)
- Nernst intuition: \(E\) shifts with concentration via \(\ln Q\)
- Flux estimate: \(J \sim -D\,\partial C/\partial x\)

## Notation: keep a small alphabet
Prefer consistency over completeness.

- **Thermo**: \(\Delta G\), \(\Delta G^\circ\), \(Q\), \(K\), \(R\), \(T\), \(F\), \(n\)
- **Transport**: \(J\) (flux), \(D\) (diffusion), \(u\) or \(w\) (advection/burial velocity)
- **Concentrations vs activities**: pick one convention per chapter and state it once; park nuance in the Energy Toolkit appendix

## What the book is (and is not)
- **Is**: a coherent bridge between geomicrobiology and modeling; a “why the model works” book
- **Is not**: a full RTM textbook, a code manual, or a comprehensive review of all metabolisms

## Repeating chapter pattern (consistent rhythm)
- Hook scene (1–2 pages)
- Concept: the biological/chemical rule
- Model: the minimal equation(s) that capture it (Equation Corner)
- Data: what you’d measure to test it
- Take‑home summary (5 bullets)

## Visual program (simple but frequent)
- Line‑drawn figures (zones, ladders, profiles, flux cartoons)
- “Microbe Cards” (half‑page): methanogens, sulfate reducers, iron reducers, cable bacteria (optional), Shewanella, deep subsurface specialists
- “Profile Detective” callouts: interpret one curve bend at a time

## References (practical)
- Keep citations light in the main text; put density in notes/appendices
- Add “Further reading” lists when a chapter touches a large literature
